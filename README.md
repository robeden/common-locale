Logic Artisan Common Core
=========================

A collection of common utilities and helper functions useful for a
wide variety of applications.

This collection isn't meant to be exhaustive and, in fact, we'd love
for it to be as small as possible. More widely used collections (such
as Guava) or the JDK itself are preferred. As new functionality from
this library is possible with those it will be migrated out of this
collection.
